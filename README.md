# DNA-Sequence-Classification
Classification of E. Coli bacteria DNA to identify if the DNA sequence is "promoter" or "non-promoter"

### Data Attribute Information:

1. One of {+/-}, indicating the class ("+" = promoter).
2. The instance name (non-promoters named by position in the 1500-long nucleotide sequence provided by T. Record).
3-59. The remaining 57 fields are the sequence, starting at position -50 (p-50) and ending at position +7 (p7). Each of these fields is filled by one of {a, g, t, c}.
